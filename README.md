# CGM-detection-model
CGM (continuous glucose monitor) can alert diabetes and blood pressure. It measures blood sugar levels every few minutes and sends the data to a receiver or a smartwatch. This allows people with diabetes to see their blood sugar levels in real-time and make adjustments to their insulin doses as needed.

CGM can also alert for high blood pressure. When blood pressure is high, the CGM will send an alert to the user's receiver or smartwatch. This allows people with high blood pressure to take action to lower their blood pressure, such as taking medication or making lifestyle changes.

CGM is a valuable tool for people with diabetes and high blood pressure. It can help people to better manage their conditions and prevent serious complications.

Here are some of the benefits of using a CGM to monitor diabetes and blood pressure:

- Real-time monitoring: CGMs provide real-time data on blood sugar levels and blood pressure, which can help people to make quick adjustments to their treatment plans.
- Improved accuracy: CGMs are more accurate than traditional fingerstick tests, which can help people to get a better understanding of their blood sugar and blood pressure levels.
- Increased convenience: CGMs are more convenient than traditional fingerstick tests, as they do not require people to prick their fingers multiple times a day.
- Reduced risk of complications: CGMs can help to reduce the risk of serious complications associated with diabetes and high blood pressure, such as heart attack, stroke, and blindness.
